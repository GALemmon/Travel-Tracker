# Travel Tracker

## Turing Mod 2 final solo project

This project created a simple app to track users' travel plans and data.  It was designed to demonstrate simple interactions with a remote API.  It utilizes fetch and post calls to interact with a remote dataset.  The underlying structure is vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on Object Oriented Programming utilizing SRP and DRY code.

## Technologies Used

This project uses:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node
- Mocha
- Chai
- Webpack

## Goals and Objectives:

- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed.
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.
- Make network POST requests to add data to a server.

## Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine.  After cloning run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the project login page. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

For the project to function you will need a remote server for the API calls.  In order to use the API calls, clone this repository: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api.git
After cloning, follow the setup instructions.

To log into the page, use the user name "traveler" + (a number between 1 and 50).  Use the password "travel".
